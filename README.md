# brain-tumor-segmentation-3D-DeepLearning
3D multi-label brain tumor segmentation from multimodal MRI (FLAIR, T1w, T1gd, T2w) using Decathlon data. End-to-end workflow with 3D SegResNet, Dice loss, and Mean Dice evaluation for glioma sub-region segmentation (edema, core, necrotic/cystic, enhancing). Focused on complex, heterogeneous tumor localization in clinical neuroimaging.
